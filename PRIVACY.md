# Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 31.iii.2025

1. **Introduction**: This Privacy Policy outlines how Authenticator Wrapped ("the Extension") handles user data. By using the Extension, you acknowledge and agree to the terms outlined in this policy.

2. **Data Collection & Storage**: Authenticator Wrapped does not collect, transmit, or store any user data outside your browser. All data related to the Extension is stored locally within your browser and remains entirely under your control.

3. **Third-Party Access**: For extensions downloaded through the Google Chrome Web Store, Readyfile Ltd, and for all other extensions, Prem Raghvani, and any third parties do not have access to, nor do they process or store, any data generated or used by the Extension. There is no data sharing, tracking, or remote storage of user information.

4. **Permissions**: The Extension only collects the log in codes for Microsoft Authenticator, and any status updates such as denials or time outs, from when you try to log on with Microsoft only. We do not collect any passwords, and all status codes are stored locally in your web browser, or in accordance with your browser's cloud synchronisation. These permissions are used solely for the intended features of the Extension and do not result in external data transmission.

5. **Security**: Since all data is stored locally, or in your browser's cloud environment, and not our services, security measures depend on your browser and device settings. We recommend keeping your browser updated and following best security practices to protect your information.

6. **Changes to This Policy**: We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in an updated version within the Extension or accompanying documentation.
