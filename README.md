# Authenticator Wrapped #

## Introduction ##

Are you a university student, or indeed anywhere else. Does your institution use the Microsoft apps, and require Microsoft Authenticator every time you log on with a code? 

At Durham University, we do too, with policies so strict that it signs the account out at random times. 

Inspired by [Durfess #37281](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/durfess37281), why not make this come true?

Please note that it may say in the extensions area that there are "Errors" - do not worry.
